# Chisel OpenNPU

This is an open-source neural processing unit implementation in Chisel3.

We expect this implementation supports:

- UInt8 GEMM Capability
- Built-in Flexible Reshape with TLB
- Sparse Tensor Support
- High Efficiency in Low Memory Bandwidth Budget
- Transformer Optimized
- And more coming...
